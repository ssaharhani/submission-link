All communication with Google Drive.

  1. Authenticate via the same service-account credentials as the Sheets service.
  2. Upload a file (bytes) to the configured Drive folder.
  3. Apply the naming convention: {Question_ID}_{Student_Name}_{Student_ID}.jpg

The teacher configures the target folder via secrets.toml → settings.drive_folder_id
